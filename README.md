# tivaC_game

Works on TivaC TM4C123G Launchpads. I don't have a sheet of the pins used for each input/output device but I will update soon.
The purpose of the game is for the user to guess the correct number on the 7-seg display. 
The user can use the 2 rotary sensors to approach the number. The frequency of the buzzer will tell the user how far is he/she from
the correct value. Slower beeping frequency means far, high beeping frequency means close. Once the correct number is being guessed,
score is calculated based on number of attempts and total time used until the correct guess.
