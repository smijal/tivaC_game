# Guess the 4 digit number game

### Description
The purpose of the game is for the user to guess the correct number.
When a new game is started, randomly generated number is pre-set and the user needs to use the 2 rotary knobs to guess the correct number.
When the user thinks they got the correct number they need to press the push button to confirm their choice.
The frequency of the beeping sound of the buzzer will hint the user how far is he/she from
the correct value. Slower beeping frequency means far, high beeping frequency means close. Once the correct number is being guessed,
score is calculated based on number of attempts and total time used until the correct guess.

### Note
Old project, can't find recordings of the demo. Code needs cleanup.
